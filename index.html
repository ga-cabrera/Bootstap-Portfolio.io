                    <p>Born and raised throughout the pacific coast, I'm just a Peruvian dude who loves food and loves learning. I'm a big Batman fan and have close to 400 comics related to the dark knight and the collection is still growing. I am a slow learner, but will kick butt in any subject I put effort into!</p>

                    <br>

                    <p> And now, some quotes I found online via <a href="http://fillerama.io/">Fillerama.io</a> :</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <p>Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Shut up and get to the point! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Oh yeah, good luck with that. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! You're going to do his laundry? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Bender, we're trying our best. No, I'm Santa Claus! The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Noâ€¦ but I'd like to be asked! I'm afraid I just blue myself. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" Steve Holt! Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Guy's a pro. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Well, what do you expect, mother? Not tricks, Michael, illusions. We just call it a sausage. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. That's why you always leave a note! Marry me. Michael!</p>
