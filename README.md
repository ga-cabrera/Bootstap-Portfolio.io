# Bootstap-Portfolio.io
creating a website using Bootstrap wireframe

This was a challenging assignment, but it worked out in the end. It looks close to my original portfolio page, the only difference is my contact form. It looks a little more simpler, but only because I felt like I was running out of time (gotta be honest here). 

the portfolio gallery photo now open up, though the photos are not very big because I sized all the photos too small. but It all still works out.

everything is responsive, which is what I appreciate about bootsrap. there's still a lot to learn, but I am enjoying digging deeper into the CDN of bootstrap.
